# Privacy Policy for FB Reels Speed Control Extension

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

## 1. Introduction
The "FB Reels Speed Control" extension ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our extension collects, uses, and discloses your information.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

### Personal Information
We **do not** collect, store, share, or sell any personal information. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not track your browsing history outside of the specific interaction with Facebook Reels necessary for the extension to function.

### Local Storage
The extension uses the Chrome `storage` API to save your preferences locally on your device. Specifically, we store:
- **Playback Speed:** The last used playback speed (e.g., 1.5x, 2.0x) so that it can be automatically applied to the next video you watch.

This data is stored locally on your browser and is not synchronized to any external servers or third-party services managed by us.

## 3. Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions for the sole purpose of functionality:
- **Host Permission (`*.facebook.com`)**: Required to inject the speed control interface into Facebook Reels videos.
- **Scripting**: Used to execute the code that creates the speed slider.
- **ActiveTab**: Used to ensure the extension can recognize when it is valid to run on the current tab.
- **Storage**: Used solely to remember your speed preference between sessions.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) or advertising networks.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the support section on the Chrome Web Store listing.
